# Name Orbs

A web applet written in processing and using processing.js to port to javascript.

Orbs are generated randomly around the screen and coalesce in the shape of the letters of my name.

Clicking the mouse causes disturbance and pushes the orbs away but releasing allows them to return to there location.
